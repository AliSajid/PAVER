   abstract = {Omics data are very valuable for researchers in biology, but the work required to develop a solid expertise in their analysis contrasts with the rapidity with which the omics technologies evolve. Data accumulate in public databases, and despite significant advances in bioinformatics softwares to integrate them, data analysis remains a burden for those who perform experiments. Beyond the issue of dealing with a very large number of results, we believe that working with omics data requires a change in the way scientific problems are solved. In this chapter, we explain pitfalls and tips we found during our functional genomics projects in yeasts. Our main lesson is that, if applying a protocol does not guarantee a successful project, following simple rules can help to become strategic and intentional, thus avoiding an endless drift into an ocean of possibilities.},

   abstract = {Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a category of pervasive disorders of the developing nervous system with few or no recognized biomarkers. A significant portion of the risk for NDDs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is contributed by the environment, and exposure to pyrethroid pesticides during pregnancy has been identified as a potential risk factor for NDD in the unborn child. We recently showed that low-dose developmental exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin in mice causes male-biased changes to ADHD- and NDD-relevant behaviors as well as the striatal dopamine system. Here, we used a multiomics approach to determine the broadest possible set of pharmacologically relevant changes in the mouse brain caused by developmental pyrethroid exposure (DPE). Using a litter-based, split-sample design, we exposed mouse dams during pregnancy and lactation to deltamethrin (3 mg/kg or vehicle every 3 days) at a concentration well below the EPA-determined benchmark dose used for regulatory guidance. We raised male offspring to adulthood, euthanized them, and pulverized and divided whole brain samples for split-sample transcriptomics, kinomics and multiomics integration. Transcriptome analysis revealed alterations to multiple canonical clock genes, and kinome analysis revealed changes in the activity of multiple kinases involved in synaptic plasticity. Multiomics integration revealed a dysregulated protein-protein interaction network containing primary clusters for mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades, synaptic function, and the regulation of apoptosis. These results demonstrate that DPE causes a multi-modal biophenotype in the brain relevant to ADHD and identifies new potential avenues for therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {Big data has become a central part of medical research, as well as modern life generally. "Omics" technologies include genomics, proteomics, microbiomics and increasingly other omics. These have been driven by rapid advances in laboratory techniques and equipment. Crucially, improved information handling capabilities have allowed concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to enter the research world. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how quickly information can be generated and analyzed using such approaches, but also showed its limitations. This review will look at how "omics" has begun to be translated into clinical practice. While there appears almost limitless potential in using big data for "precision" or "personalized" medicine, the reality is that this remains largely aspirational. Oncology is the only field of medicine that is widely adopting such technologies, and even in this field uptake is irregular. There are practical and ethical reasons for this lack of translation of increasingly affordable techniques into the clinic. Undoubtedly, there will be increasing use of large data sets from traditional (e.g. tumor samples, patient genomics) and nontraditional (e.g. smartphone) sources. It is perhaps the greatest challenge of the health-care sector over the coming decade to integrate these resources in an effective, practical and ethical way.},

   abstract = {Multi-omics, variously called integrated omics, pan-omics, and trans-omics, aims to combine two or more omics data sets to aid in data analysis, visualization and interpretation to determine the mechanism of a biological process. Multi-omics efforts have taken center stage in biomedical research leading to the development of new insights into biological events and processes. However, the mushrooming of a myriad of tools, datasets, and approaches tends to inundate the literature and overwhelm researchers new to the field. The aims of this review are to provide an overview of the current state of the field, inform on available reliable resources, discuss the application of statistics and machine/deep learning in multi-omics analyses, discuss findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) research, and point to best practices in benchmarking. Thus, we provide guidance to interested users of the domain by addressing challenges of the underlying biology, giving an overview of the available toolset, addressing common pitfalls, and acknowledging current methods' limitations. We conclude with practical advice and recommendations on software engineering and reproducibility practices to share a comprehensive awareness with new researchers in multi-omics for end-to-end workflow.},

   abstract = {Pathway analysis is a set of widely used tools for research in life sciences intended to give meaning to high-throughput biological data. The methodology of these tools settles in the gathering and usage of knowledge that comprise biomolecular functioning, coupled with statistical testing and other algorithms. Despite their wide employment, pathway analysis foundations and overall background may not be fully understood, leading to misinterpretation of analysis results. This review attempts to comprise the fundamental knowledge to take into consideration when using pathway analysis as a hypothesis generation tool. We discuss the key elements that are part of these methodologies, their capabilities and current deficiencies. We also present an overview of current and all-time popular methods, highlighting different classes across them. In doing so, we show the exploding diversity of methods that pathway analysis encompasses, point out commonly overlooked caveats, and direct attention to a potential new class of methods that attempt to zoom the analysis scope to the sample scale.},

   abstract = {The Gene Ontology (GO) is a cornerstone of functional genomics research that drives discoveries through knowledge-informed computational analysis of biological data from large-scale assays. Key to this success is how the GO can be used to support hypotheses or conclusions about the biology or evolution of a study system by identifying annotated functions that are overrepresented in subsets of genes of interest. Graphical visualizations of such GO term enrichment results are critical to aid interpretation and avoid biases by presenting researchers with intuitive visual data summaries. Amongst current visualization tools and resources there is a lack of standalone open-source software solutions that facilitate explorations of key features of multiple lists of GO terms. To address this we developed GO-Figure!, an open-source Python software for producing user-customisable semantic similarity scatterplots of redundancy-reduced GO term lists. The lists are simplified by grouping together terms with similar functions using their quantified information contents and semantic similarities, with user-control over grouping thresholds. Representatives are then selected for plotting in two-dimensional semantic space where similar terms are placed closer to each other on the scatterplot, with an array of user-customisable graphical attributes. GO-Figure! offers a simple solution for command-line plotting of informative summary visualizations of lists of GO terms, designed to support exploratory data analyses and dataset comparisons.},

   abstract = {Pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) is a computational biology method that identifies biological functions that are overrepresented in a group of genes more than would be expected by chance and ranks these functions by relevance. The relative abundance of genes pertinent to specific pathways is measured through statistical methods, and associated functional pathways are retrieved from online bioinformatics databases. In the last decade, along with the spread of the internet, higher availability of computational resources made PEA software tools easy to access and to use for bioinformatics practitioners worldwide. Although it became easier to use these tools, it also became easier to make mistakes that could generate inflated or misleading results, especially for beginners and inexperienced computational biologists. With this article, we propose nine quick tips to avoid common mistakes and to out a complete, sound, thorough PEA, which can produce relevant and robust results. We describe our nine guidelines in a simple way, so that they can be understood and used by anyone, including students and beginners. Some tips explain what to do before starting a PEA, others are suggestions of how to correctly generate meaningful results, and some final guidelines indicate some useful steps to properly interpret PEA results. Our nine tips can help users perform better pathway enrichment analyses and eventually contribute to a better understanding of current biology.},

Innovative solutions for data management, data sharing, and for discovering novel datasets are therefore increasingly required.

OmicsDI aggregates genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and multiomics datasets, as well as computational models of biological processes. Here, we propose a set of novel metrics to quantify the attention and impact of biomedical datasets. A complete framework (now integrated into OmicsDI) has been implemented in order to provide and evaluate those metrics. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations for authors, journals and data resources to promote an optimal quantification of the impact of datasets.},
